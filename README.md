### TradeAI - ChatGPT, and Machine Learning enhanced Portfolio Management System

## Features:
    - Symbol Screener (S&P500 index, ~500 symbols: 30% of best performers) 
    - Sentiment Analysizer (Mean Sentiment, and Conformal information)
    - (WIP) Voice Transcriber...? (whisper openai)
    - (WIP) Full-Stack Application features.... (Flask???, Streamlit???)

## Usage and TODOs:
    - Improving on overall modility of the application. Most python files are not encapsulated yet, and are still underdevelopment. 
    - The front end of the application needs work, and styling. The graphs need a new way of reanimation.
    - The menu, and overall functionality of the application needs to be analysized on eou
    - Modules must be named, and updated
    - Configurations must be written
    - Requirements must be documented
    


### In addition to the CLI interface 

In addition to the CLI interface, I will be working to provide a LTM module on top of the OpenAI provide API. I will be researching more embedding techniques, improving the toknizer, parser, and working towards generally improving the LLM model.. but general optimizion, fine tuning and expanding the dimensionality of this application has become a key goal of mine. For my convenience I've intentionally built onto a AI framework. Currently Im working on allocating space, and gather data for my experiments. Consequently, I've taken this upon myself, and has become work in itself.
